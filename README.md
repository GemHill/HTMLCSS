# MGG-HTML-CSS
A respository for material for the September 2017 intro to HTML/CSS/Github event

To set up git on your computer, see Github's instructions here: https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/

To set up a copy of these files on your own GitHib account, the easiest way to do this is to:

1. Download the files by clicking on Clone or Download then Download Zip
2. Create a repo in your own space: Click on the + by your profile picture, and then click on Create New Repository
2a. Give it a name and a URL
2b. Check the box next to Initialize this repository with a README
3. Copy the URL on the next screen (It will be in the format https://github.com/GemHill/test.git
3a. Go to a terminal, type `cd Desktop` to move to your computer's desktop (or  `cd Documents`, or another folder)
3b. Type in git clone <URL you copied>
This will set up a folder for your repository on your computer
4. Copy and paste the files for your site into the new folder (this can be done however you normally move files)
5. In your terminal, type `git status`
This should show you a list of files in red. This is expected
6. Type `git add .`
6a. You may see a message asking you to write a commit message. Write a message describing what you've added (or committed) to the repo. 'Initial commit' is fine here. This will add your files to the git respository
